                I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend
                thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and
                development, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance
                and usability.

                In my spare time, I'm usually rock climbing, reading tech blogs, hanging out with my dog, or exploring
